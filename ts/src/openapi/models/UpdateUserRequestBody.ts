If no roles are defined, the user will be prompted to select a role within Kanmon. <br/><br/>A primary owner is a user with the authority to issue debt on behalf of the business. <br/>This means the user can complete onboarding, receive offers, choose to accept offers, <br/>sign financing agreements, and service an active issued product. <br/><br/>An operator is a user with permission to service an active issued product. Examples are uploading invoices on <br/>behalf of the business, checking the status of payments, etc. <br /><br/>Please note Kanmon supports an additional user role called secondary owners. <br/>Secondary owners are beneficial owners of a business, like primary owners, and Kanmon <br/>must perform KYC checks for these users. Kanmon will handle creating and managing <br/>these users for KYC purposes through a separate process. <br/>
